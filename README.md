# Overview
Welcome to my very first programming project! This simple app was created as a demonstration of the coding skills I began learning when I started my programming journey. While it may be basic, it represents a significant milestone in my development as a programmer.

## Features
Basic Functionality: This app was built to demonstrate my understanding of the fundamental programming concepts I was learning at the time.
Simple User Interface: The UI is minimal and designed to help users interact with the app's core features without any distractions.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java

Sketchware coding app was actually made use of.

## How It Works
As probably guessed, there is so little going on in the background. The program simply generates some random numbers, and with each random numbers it does attach texts to it, printing them out in the output.

## How It's used
One simply asks a question of 'yes','no', and 'maybe' in mind, and click on the button. The random output is gotten with each click. 'Crazy', I'd say (as do you)!

This was just a learning tool, hence I have no intention of advancing it. Meanwhile, feel free to engage with the app and contribute.

Importantly, ensure to check out the exciting projects I am and will be working on, especially in the area of Computer Vision and Image Processing.

## Credits
Thanks to the Community Based Development Partners (CBDP) for the coding program that opened this world to me. I will forever be indebted to them. Do well to check them out at [CBDPartners.org](https://www.cbdpartners.org).
Make donation to the amazing work those guys are doing. Thanks!
